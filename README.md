#Goals:
We wanted to create controller that allows user to physicly steer and control Blender object in real time.
User could for example animate camera movement with our conttroller, moving his normal camera operations skills directly in to virtual enviroment. That can possibly save a lot of time and allow to create reallife camere behaviour in blender.

#Future:
Project devlopment has been stoped at the moment.

Data collection from sensors is working and can be used in future project.

#Conclusion
Biggest problem we encauntered was that bare reallife messurment are not accuarate enugh to simply base on them for futhere calculations. Definetly collected data needs to be postprocessed what we did not have time for. Not without reason it is called raw data. Probably some Interpolation and damping functions could improve resoults.
