## Goals:
We wanted to create controller that allows user to physicly steer and control Blender object in real time.
User using our conttroller could for example animate camera movement, transitioning his normal camera operation skills directly in to virtual enviroment. That can possibly save a lot of time and allow to create reallife camere behaviour in animations.

## Future:
Data collection from sensors is working and can be used in future project.
**Project devlopment has been stoped at the moment.**

## Conclusion
Biggest problem we had encauntered was that reallife messurment are not accuarate enugh to simply base on them for future calculations. Definetly collected data needs to be postprocessed what we did't have time for. Not without reason it's beeing called raw data. Probably some Interpolation and damping functions could improve resoults.
